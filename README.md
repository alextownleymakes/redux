I started this project following a YouTube tutorial to create a to-do list with Redux. My prior experience with React had never included working with Redux but it seems to be a common technology in companies with a React front-end, so I decided to learn it.

The tutorial I followed utilized Redux to create a state in which the to-do items are stored. It stopped short of full functionality, so I chose to continue the development of the app and added:
- Press enter to save to-do
- Material UI button instead of HTML button
- Save to-dos to local storage
- Read to-dos from local storage on app load
- Delete to-dos

It's a simple app that was a great introduction to Redux for me.

The original tutorial was by the YouTube channel Clever Programmer, and can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBigGpLRMtU
